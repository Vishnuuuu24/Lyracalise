**v0.4.3: Home Screen Widget & Glassy UI**
- **Home Screen Widget:** Add a beautiful, glassy widget for medium and large sizes that displays the current lyric, song, and artist in real time, using App Group data sharing.
- **Glassy Backgrounds:** Both the widget and live activity now use a fully transparent, system glass background for a modern look.
- **Live Activity Improvements:** Live activity now matches the widget's style and only one is ever active at a time.
- **Auto Font Fitting:** All text in the widget auto-adjusts to fit perfectly, never overlapping or truncating.
- **Bug Fixes & Polish:** Improved reliability, fixed background warnings, and ensured seamless data updates between app and widget.
